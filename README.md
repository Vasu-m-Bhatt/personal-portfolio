## Week 2 Update – CSS Styling

In Week 2, external CSS was added to enhance the visual appearance of the portfolio website.

### Improvements Made

- Applied a custom color palette for a consistent theme
- Improved spacing using margin and padding
- Styled text, lists, and form elements
- Added hover effects for links and buttons
- Used Flexbox for layout alignment

This update focuses on separating structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) while improving user experience and design clarity.

# Week 3 Update - Js

## Project Overview
This is a personal portfolio website created as part of Week 3 of the web development program.  
The goal of this project is to make the website interactive using JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)

## JavaScript Features Implemented
The following interactive features were implemented using an external JavaScript file:

1. **Dark / Light Mode Toggle**
   - Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
   - Implemented using DOM manipulation and class toggling.

2. **Show / Hide About Section**
   - A button is used to hide or show the About Me section.
   - Demonstrates dynamic content control using JavaScript.

3. **Contact Form Validation**
   - The form checks whether all input fields are filled before submission.
   - Displays an error message if any field is empty.
   - Uses event listeners and prevents page reload.

## JavaScript Concepts Used
- Variables and functions
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Form validation with error messages
- Reusable functions

## File Structure
- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `style.css` – Styling for the website
- `script.js` – JavaScript functionality
- `images/` – Folder containing images

## Conclusion
This project helped me understand how JavaScript can be used to add interactivity and improve user experience on a website.
